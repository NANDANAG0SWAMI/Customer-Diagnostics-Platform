# 1. Start with a lean, official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /code

# 3. Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable
# This tells Python where to look for our code, solving import issues
ENV PYTHONPATH=/code

# 4. Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker's layer caching
COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

# 5. Install the Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

# 6. Copy our application code into the container
COPY ./app /code/app

# 7. Expose port 8000 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8000

# 8. The command to run when the container starts
# This starts the Uvicorn server, which runs our FastAPI application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

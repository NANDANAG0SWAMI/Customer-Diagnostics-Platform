# --- STAGE 1: Build the React Application ---
# Start with a Node.js image to get the build tools (npm, etc.)
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory for our build stage
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files first
# This takes advantage of Docker caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install all the project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of our application's source code
COPY . .

# Run the production build command defined in package.json
RUN npm run build

# --- STAGE 2: Serve the Built Application ---
# Start with a very lightweight web server (nginx)
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Copy the built static files from our 'build' stage into the web server's public directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy our custom nginx configuration file
# This is crucial for single-page applications like React to handle routing correctly
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80 (the default nginx port)
EXPOSE 80

# The default command for the nginx image will start the web server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
